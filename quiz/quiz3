1)
.* is the element-wise multiplicatoin that does not obey the laws of linear algebra. Ex. a = [1 2 3 4], b = [1 2 3 4],  a.*b

ans =

     1     4     9    16
     
* is the matrix multiplication that obeys linear algebra rules. So you do row*columns. Ex. 
a =

     1     2
     3     4

>> b = [1 2;3 4]

b =

     1     2
     3     4

>> a*b

ans =

     7    10
    15    22

2)
sum(a.*b)

3)a)
function test = testString()
  prompt = 'tell me what your string is';
  mystring = input(prompt); 
   if(mystring.equals('MATLAB'))
        test = true;
        disp test;
   else
        test = false;
        disp test;
end



b) We can use == or we can use strcmp. The main difference between == and strcmp is that strcmp is the matlab recomeneded operator for s
for string compare, whereas == just checks to see which elements of the2 strings are 'equal'. == means charecter by charecter comparison 
and is strings are of differnt length, it will retturn an error

4)I - logical without shortcuiting(just works as an 'or' to matlab) - used to operate on logical vectors and scalers
II - is the logical with short circuting which is used for code effecinecy because it works as an 'or' and 'not' in Matlab.

5)>> a = 1;
>> b = 0;
>> x = a/b<10.0
x =
     0
 
6)I would use a structure array because I dont have to enter in (AOS(n).grade = 20 and AOS(n).name = 'foobar1') everytime to input a 
value into the structure. I can use the structure array and use MATLAB built in operator mean and sum to calculate the average.

7) 

. function root = getRoot(a,b,c)
prompt = 'What is the first number';
a = input(prompt);
prompt = 'What is the second number';
b = input(prompt);
prompt = 'What is the third number';
c = input(prompt);
disp (((-1*b)+ sqrt(b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a));
disp (((-1*b)- sqrt(b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a));
end

8) a = @(x,a,b)(integral(x^2+c*x+1),a,b)

9) 
function y = getFac(n_int)
    n_int = input('Your number');
    if class(n_int) == double;
        
        Fac(n_int) = Fac(n_int-1)*n_int;
        Fac(1) = 1;
end
